As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't specific information available about a school named "Sree Jayam School" that I can provide. It's possible that this school might be a local institution or one that hasn't gained widespread recognition or documentation in sources available up to my last update.

If "Sree Jayam School" is a newly established institution or one that gained prominence after my last update, I would recommend searching for more recent information online or through local directories and educational authorities in the relevant region.

Krishna Nagar is a common place name in India, and there are several areas, localities, and neighborhoods across the country with this name. Without more context or specifics about which Krishna Nagar you're referring to, it's challenging to provide detailed information.

Krishna Nagar is often a residential area and may have amenities such as schools, parks, markets, and transportation facilities. It could be located in various cities or towns across India.

If you could provide more details or specify which Krishna Nagar you're interested in, I could offer more tailored information about that particular location.
